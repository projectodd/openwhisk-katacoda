## Congratulations

We have now learned how to:

* Write a simple JavaScript function
* Deploy the function to Apache OpenWhisk
* Invoke the function and see the results

Please take sometime to play with other related scenarios that are available to get yourself familiarized with various serverless concepts on Apache OpenWhisk. Good Luck!
